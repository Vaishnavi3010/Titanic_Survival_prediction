# Titanic_Survival_prediction
The Titanic Survival Prediction using Logistic Regression is a data-driven model built to forecast the likelihood of passengers surviving the Titanic disaster. Employing logistic regression, a powerful statistical method for binary classification, the model analyzes relevant features such as passenger age, class, and gender.
